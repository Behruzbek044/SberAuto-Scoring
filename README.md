# SberAuto-Scoring

In this project we have given the real data of the company «СберАвтоподписка». We are given information from the website sessions (1.8 Million records) and information about each hit (15.7 Million records) from which we need to do a scoring for the potensial clients.

In the notebook provided above I completed some Data Cleaning, Explorationa and Visualization, Transfromation; after splitting the ready data I splitted the data indo testing and training samples and Trained on 3 different models, after some hyperparameter tuning I chose the best performing model (RandomForestClassifier) as a pickle file for the further use.
